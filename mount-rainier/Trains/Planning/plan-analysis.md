# Plan Analysis

## Questions

1) Can two locations be directly connected by two connections of different colors?
2) Can the Tournament Manager be controlled by a person or is it fully autonomous?
3) What is exacly meant by "clients that implement the 'physical' aspects of the server-client communication"
4) How much of the game is the observer allowed to see? If they see too much there is the potential for cheating.
5) Does the obeserver observe a single player or the whole game, and are they observing live or is there a saved replay that they observe.
