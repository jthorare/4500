  Self eval: 10/10
  
  Map visualizer: 
  
  Main method: 10/10
  1. Function for drawing cities: 0/10
  2. Function for drawing connections: 0/10
  
  - If your map does not have cities and connections, what does it render?
  
  
  Managing game state:
  1. Player state: 4/5
  - Apart from obtaining a card and obtaining connections more actions will be required.
  2. Refree state: 2/5
  - The refree will also have knowlegde of the cards and destinations of all the player. This cannot be shared with all the players. This is private to the refree
  and all players should not be able to access this.
  - Hence the state cannot be same for player and refree.
  -Explain what a connection will have, eg segment count, color
  3. Handling turns: 1/5
  - Specify how player turns will be handled.
  4. Function wishlist: 5/5 
  - Good brainstorming!
