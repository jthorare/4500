## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 4

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. the method/function header for determining all connections available for
   acquisition plus at least one unit test
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/acadia/blob/b0f539319cdc3f4777c6dbc26aa8121734e51c02/Trains/Other/Source/Models/GameStates/player-game-state.cs#L44-L47
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/acadia/blob/b0f539319cdc3f4777c6dbc26aa8121734e51c02/Trains/Other/Tests/Unit/TrainsModelsGameStatesTests.cs#L95-L104

2. the method/function header for deciding the legality of an acquisition
   request from a player to the referee,  plus at least two unit tests
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/acadia/blob/b0f539319cdc3f4777c6dbc26aa8121734e51c02/Trains/Other/Source/Models/GameStates/referee-game-state.cs#L41-L54

3. the method/function header for producing a player-game state from a
   referee-game state,  plus a unit test
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/acadia/blob/b0f539319cdc3f4777c6dbc26aa8121734e51c02/Trains/Other/Source/Models/GameStates/referee-game-state.cs#L23-L26

The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
