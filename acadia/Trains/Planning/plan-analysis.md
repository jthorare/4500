## Questions

1. How does the referee decide what map to provide? What places, connections, and destinations make it up?
2. How many players can play? min/max?
3. Are destinations worth a variable amount of points?
	+ The Overview section tells us "Each destination is worth some number of points", but the Scoring section says they're all worth 10 points.
4. Will AI players communicate their actions via JSON being sent over TCP, or will they sign up like that and then we automate their actions with some basic game-playing algorithm?
