Trains.com was a semester long project developed with the intention of learning how to navigate obscure project requirements that continually changed over the course of the project cycle. It was developed in a collaborative manner where project members continually onboarded new developers and were onboarded onto other codebases as well. It wrapped up with implementing the Remote Proxy pattern in order to practice separating business logic with communication logic between users and the host server.
